&ldquo;From there, it was all downhill.&rdquo;
In a very very positive context. Going downhill on one of the mountains (there are at least 74. give or take 60. maybe 10. you get the point.) around Oeschinensee is one of the most exhilarating experiences ever. For multiple reasons:

The blue blue waters of Oeschinensee
The magnificent view of the Alps all around
The green grass with white and yellow flowers
The combination of all of the above at the same place
The feeling of accomplishment after going uphill

Oeschinensee is one of the bluest lakes you&rsquo;ll ever see. To say that the hiking paths along the lake are scenic is an understatement.
Getting there was time consuming but fairly simple: train from Geneva to Kandersteg, walk from Kandersteg railway station to Kandersteg cable car station, take the cable car up the mountain, the hike officially starts here. Just when the hike starts to get slightly difficult and you open your mouth to complain, you see the mesmerizing views and forget to complain."><meta name=keywords content><meta property="og:url" content="https://varshabhat.com/hikes/lake/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Varsha Yes But"><meta property="og:title" content="Varsha Yes But"><meta property="og:description" content="Going down a mountain (really fast) “From there, it was all downhill.”

Getting there was time consuming but fairly simple: train from Geneva to Kandersteg, walk from Kandersteg railway station to Kandersteg cable car station, take the cable car up the mountain, the hike officially starts here. Just when the hike starts to get slightly difficult and you open your mouth to complain, you see the mesmerizing views and forget to complain.</p><p>And so, we hiked, soaking in the view, not complaining, appreciating being in the moment. We walked the sandy paths and reached a small waterfall. You won&rsquo;t believe what we saw next. A snake! When I tell this story to my grandkids, I&rsquo;ll tell them how we escaped the wrath of the deadliest snake known to mankind, at least 7feet in length, ready to devour us whole. However, since I owe honesty to my readers, I will reveal that the snake was no bigger than my palm, some might even mistake it for a worm. Seemed like a chill guy, was on his way up the mountain, did not pay much attention to us. Probably got scared of us even, but continued on his way upwards. We wished him the very best and parted ways.</p><p>We resumed the hike until we reached a scenic point (to be fair, every point in the hike was scenic) with benches to sit on and another waterfall on the side. No snake this time. After chilling here for a grand total of 15 minutes, we headed back, because we wanted to try the adventure of a lifetime** awaiting us. We looked for the snake on the way back, but he wasn&rsquo;t around. After hiking down some more and then some more, we were back at the cable car station. Now, we&rsquo;ve already lived a very interesting hike experience so far, but this is where things get even more intriguing.</p><p>After doing the Panoramaweg hike in Oeschinensee, there are multiple options: you could hike down the mountain all the way to Kandersteg and put your knee through a lot of compressive force^, or you could be like the cool people(as previously established <a href=/trips/helicopter>here</a>) and take a mountain coaster***. We obviously chose the cool option and bought three tickets for the mountain coaster (it might be useful to mention at this point that we were three people). And then the mountain coaster ride began. And from there, truly, it was all downhill. Fast, windy, and entirely worth it. I thought I was going at dangerously high speeds until my friends complained that I wasn&rsquo;t going fast enough. The mountain coaster did not change me as a person, but it did make me feel like I was 13 and on a school trip.</p><p>I could go on and on, and you could read on and on, or we could both save some time and watch <a href="https://youtu.be/Iu3FCDjiiRk?si=DQKPfE8jbGd8SZ1P">this video Yash^^ made</a>.

You cannot descend the mountain with the mountain coaster, it is a loop.
