&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;From there, it was all downhill.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a very very positive context. Going downhill on one of the mountains (there are at least 74. give or take 60. maybe 10. you get the point.) around Oeschinensee is one of the most exhilarating experiences ever. For multiple reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The blue blue waters of Oeschinensee&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The magnificent view of the Alps all around&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The green grass with white and yellow flowers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The combination of all of the above at the same place&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The feeling of accomplishment after going uphill&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Oeschinensee is one of the bluest lakes you&amp;rsquo;ll ever see. To say that the hiking paths along the lake are scenic is an understatement.
Getting there was time consuming but fairly simple: train from Geneva to Kandersteg, walk from Kandersteg railway station to Kandersteg cable car station, take the cable car up the mountain, the hike officially starts here. Just when the hike starts to get slightly difficult and you open your mouth to complain, you see the mesmerizing views and forget to complain.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://varshabhat.com/hikes/le-reculet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varshabhat.com/hikes/le-reculet/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="le-reculet">Le Reculet&lt;/h2>
