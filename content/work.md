# Work

Currently, I work as a Cloud Engineer at CERN. I work on OpenStack, my work involves working on the OpenStack services and disaster recovery. 

Previously, I worked at Citrix as a DevOps engineer for 1.5 years, prior to which I interned in the same team for 6 months. I worked on Monitoring, Automation and Observability as Code. I also collaborated a bit with the security team.
