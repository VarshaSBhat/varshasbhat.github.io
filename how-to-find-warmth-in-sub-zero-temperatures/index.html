If Maslow’s hierarchy of needs taught us anything, it’s that physiological needs come first. You ensure the heater works, but it’s still quite cold.</p><p>Winter slowly fades out to give way to spring. You find people who enjoy drinking the same type of tea as you. It’s not that cold anymore, majorly because winter is gone, but also because now you have people to share a cup of tea with. It’s still not completely warm. Home is thousands of kilometers away.</p><p>Summer is a bitch. You regret complaining about winter. You would strip off your skin if you could. It’s hot. That doesn’t stop you from drinking the same tea with the same people. Familiarity is a strange thing. You don’t check the schedule before taking the shuttle anymore. You know where to find cats to pet. The sound of le lion that you once found eerie is now calming. The walk across Le Lion is muscle memory. You know as you walk into Carrefour at 6:30pm that you’re in for a long wait at the queue. You know that the people who come through for you every single time no matter what, are going to be there.</p><p>Saint-Genis-Pouilly looks adorable in fall colors. Home is not far away, it’s right here.</p><p>It’s time for winter again. Only this time, you’re not worried about looking for warmth, because you know how to create it.</p></content><p></p></main><footer>Made with <a href=https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/>Hugo ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Bear</a></footer></body></html>
