&lt;p>In a very very positive context. Going downhill on one of the mountains (there are at least 74. give or take 60. maybe 10. you get the point.) around Oeschinensee is one of the most exhilarating experiences ever. For multiple reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The blue blue waters of Oeschinensee&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The magnificent view of the Alps all around&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The green grass with white and yellow flowers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The combination of all of the above at the same place&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The feeling of accomplishment after going uphill&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Oeschinensee is one of the bluest lakes you&amp;rsquo;ll ever see. To say that the hiking paths along the lake are scenic is an understatement. For us who live in the middle of nowhere, getting there was time consuming but fairly simple: Board a train in Geneva, get off at Kandersteg. Walk from the Kandersteg railway station to Kandersteg cable car station - this should take about 15 minutes (or 45 if you stop for pictures now and then). Take the cable car up the mountain, and the hike officially starts here. Snowcapped peaks all around, grass on the hills in front of you, the pretty town of Kandersteg far far below. Oeschinensee is not in sight yet, but as you walk along, you see hidden bits of blue from in between the tree branches.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to find warmth in sub-zero temperatures</title><link>https://varshabhat.com/blog/how-to-find-warmth-in-sub-zero-temperatures/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 15:48:26 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://varshabhat.com/blog/how-to-find-warmth-in-sub-zero-temperatures/</guid><description>&lt;p>No, Saint-Genis-Pouilly is not THAT cold. It gets cold, but it’s not to an extent where you’d lose your toes to frostbite. At most, your voice trembles and your teeth chatter and your fingers freeze over every time you need to text someone. 6°C in December is not bad. However, add to it other factors like being away from home for the first time, and it gets slightly colder. The pressure of having to do things because you’re in your early 20s and you have to enjoy life. It goes from 6°C to -10°C. The perils of starting a new life in a whole new city, country and continent whose languages and ways you don’t quite understand yet. It goes to “feels like -50°C. And you’re left looking for warmth. Because that’s what you’re used to. Warmth. 35°C. Coming home to people you love. Hanging out with friends you’ve known for years. Being fed and taken care of without a worry in the world.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beyond</title><link>https://varshabhat.com/beyond/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 16:13:56 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://varshabhat.com/beyond/</guid><description>&lt;p>What is a Varsha beyond her job and travel?

&lt;p>Luna is very non chalant. Very elegant. Very cat.
She ignores you when you give her attention and then comes running behind you like she was planning to go that way anyway. She has a certain air of authority to her, like she is the one making the rules. She pretends like you&amp;rsquo;re the least important thing to her and she could not care less about you. But when you walk away she&amp;rsquo;ll run behind you nonetheless.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://varshabhat.com/trips/aosta/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varshabhat.com/trips/aosta/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="running-into-long-lost-childhood-friend---this-time-in-the-middle-of-the-italian-alps">Running into long lost childhood friend - this time in the middle of the Italian Alps&lt;/h3>

And you&amp;rsquo;re not entirely wrong, because this post too is about Chaithra, my school friend that I talk to everyday, who actively mindfully planned to visit and stay with me, not in the middle of Italian Alps but near the French Juras. She was slightly offended that I never told her that the word Jurassic comes from the Juras where dinosaur fossils were first found.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://varshabhat.com/trips/como/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varshabhat.com/trips/como/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="trying-to-buy-sunscreen-in-the-middle-of-spring">Trying to buy sunscreen in the middle of spring&lt;/h3></description></item><item><title/><link>https://varshabhat.com/trips/grindelwald/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varshabhat.com/trips/grindelwald/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-whole-lot-of-nothing-and-a-little-bit-of-everything">A whole lot of nothing and a little bit of everything&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s snow as far as eyes can see, and little else. If you squint hard enough you can probably spot a hiker or two in the distance. If you&amp;rsquo;re here and at a risk of hypothermia, you can be fairly certain that you are in Jungfraujoch, the highest railway station in Europe.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://varshabhat.com/trips/gruyeres/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varshabhat.com/trips/gruyeres/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="how-long-does-a-postcard-take-to-reach-home">How long does a postcard take to reach home?&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll come clean right away. Let&amp;rsquo;s break down the truth in the title:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Running into&amp;rdquo; - we actively planned for months to meet up, we did not just run into each other. I planned this trip specifically to visit and stay with said friend. This was not a coincidence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;long lost&amp;rdquo; - we talk, share memes and photos every single day.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;childhood&amp;rdquo; - this is true, i met said friend at 13, that is childhood. some may argue that 13 is teenage and not childhood, but at my age 13 is definitely childhood.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;friend&amp;rdquo; - said friend is way past the &amp;ldquo;friend&amp;rdquo; tier. said friend has a say in my decisions. mom loves said friend.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;in the middle of the North Sea&amp;rdquo; - we met on land. we were not feeling adventurous enough to swim to the middle of the North Sea to meet each other at the time of this trip. some day we will, i think.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve cleared that up, we can discuss the details.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://varshabhat.com/trips/turin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varshabhat.com/trips/turin/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="realizing-the-meaning-of-life-in-a-pizzeria-in-turin">Realizing the meaning of life in a pizzeria in Turin&lt;/h3>
