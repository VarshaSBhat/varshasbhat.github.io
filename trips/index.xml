&lt;p>Luna is very non chalant. Very elegant. Very cat.
She ignores you when you give her attention and then comes running behind you like she was planning to go that way anyway. She has a certain air of authority to her, like she is the one making the rules. She pretends like you&amp;rsquo;re the least important thing to her and she could not care less about you. But when you walk away she&amp;rsquo;ll run behind you nonetheless.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://varshabhat.com/trips/aosta/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varshabhat.com/trips/aosta/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="running-into-long-lost-childhood-friend---this-time-in-the-middle-of-the-italian-alps">Running into long lost childhood friend - this time in the middle of the Italian Alps&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve read &lt;a href="https://varshabhat.com/trips/sweden-and-denmark">this&lt;/a> you probably think I&amp;rsquo;m a big fat liar.
And you&amp;rsquo;re not entirely wrong, because this post too is about Chaithra, my school friend that I talk to everyday, who actively mindfully planned to visit and stay with me, not in the middle of Italian Alps but near the French Juras. She was slightly offended that I never told her that the word Jurassic comes from the Juras where dinosaur fossils were first found.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://varshabhat.com/trips/como/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varshabhat.com/trips/como/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="trying-to-buy-sunscreen-in-the-middle-of-spring">Trying to buy sunscreen in the middle of spring&lt;/h3></description></item><item><title/><link>https://varshabhat.com/trips/grindelwald/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varshabhat.com/trips/grindelwald/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-whole-lot-of-nothing-and-a-little-bit-of-everything">A whole lot of nothing and a little bit of everything&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s snow as far as eyes can see, and little else. If you squint hard enough you can probably spot a hiker or two in the distance. If you&amp;rsquo;re here and at a risk of hypothermia, you can be fairly certain that you are in Jungfraujoch, the highest railway station in Europe.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://varshabhat.com/trips/gruyeres/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varshabhat.com/trips/gruyeres/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="how-long-does-a-postcard-take-to-reach-home">How long does a postcard take to reach home?&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>It didn&amp;rsquo;t.
It was mad fun though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chateau d&amp;rsquo;oex hosts the annual hot air balloon festival every January. But only noobs go on hot air balloon rides at a hot air balloon festival. Cool People™️ go on helicopter rides. The fact that helicopter rides are way more affordable than hot air balloon rides is irrelevant here.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://varshabhat.com/trips/home/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varshabhat.com/trips/home/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="after-a-year-in-strange-land-i-go-home">After a year in strange land, I go home&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Planning ahead and carefully organizing the details are important for any trip.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Except this one we just went on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We winged every aspect of the trip that could possibly be winged, and it was insane.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being from Mangalore, I was facing a severe lack of beaches in a land-locked Switzerland. Waving to the ocean moved me in ways I cannot describe. They moved me even as my feet were lodged in the sand. They moved my hair in ways that covered my face.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://varshabhat.com/trips/rome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varshabhat.com/trips/rome/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="random-girl-from-egypt-does-my-eyeliner-in-rome">Random girl from Egypt does my eyeliner in Rome&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll come clean right away. Let&amp;rsquo;s break down the truth in the title:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Running into&amp;rdquo; - we actively planned for months to meet up, we did not just run into each other. I planned this trip specifically to visit and stay with said friend. This was not a coincidence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;long lost&amp;rdquo; - we talk, share memes and photos every single day.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;childhood&amp;rdquo; - this is true, i met said friend at 13, that is childhood. some may argue that 13 is teenage and not childhood, but at my age 13 is definitely childhood.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;friend&amp;rdquo; - said friend is way past the &amp;ldquo;friend&amp;rdquo; tier. said friend has a say in my decisions. mom loves said friend.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;in the middle of the North Sea&amp;rdquo; - we met on land. we were not feeling adventurous enough to swim to the middle of the North Sea to meet each other at the time of this trip. some day we will, i think.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve cleared that up, we can discuss the details.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://varshabhat.com/trips/turin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varshabhat.com/trips/turin/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="realizing-the-meaning-of-life-in-a-pizzeria-in-turin">Realizing the meaning of life in a pizzeria in Turin&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I did not realize the meaning of life in a pizzeria in Turin. I did however realize that Turin does have some of the most amazing pizzas. Turin also has a lot of pizzazz.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://varshabhat.com/trips/valle-verzasca/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varshabhat.com/trips/valle-verzasca/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="when-an-unexpected-hiking-path-appears-you-hike">When an unexpected hiking path appears, you hike&lt;/h3>
